**Chaos Protocol** is a simulation game where you have a rule engine and objects, which you can apply rules to! By default, the game launches with random rules.
Basically a framework of sorts, which can even be random!

The game has Scratch-like blocks and conditions, and everything you probably need for a simple game.
The problem: it hasn't been well tested.

## Speed is a big problem of the project, especially collision detections, which are very expensive.
I am not using spatial hashing right now, and i had no time to optimize the code. I'm sorry.
